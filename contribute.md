# Programming Historian Summer Fellowship, Applications Open

<img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-ktYj62pxbl0/U5NrANYt3AI/AAAAAAAAEzI/KaZ9zSoS0DY/Flickr-5855095781.jpg" style="float: left; width: 325px; margin-right: 15px;"/>

The Programming Historian seeks applications to its Summer Fellowship program. This is a volunteer position. The purpose of the Summer Fellowship is to welcome a scholar interested in digital history or digital humanities to the editorial team of the Programming Historian and to foster their interests and skills in the field through mentorship and practical skills development during the summer of 2015.

Fellows will have the opportunity to develop an idea of their choosing (ideas supplied if needed), which the editors will help them to turn into an effective tutorial, published on the Programming Historian website. The initial fellowship is a part time, casual commitment of three months, but fellows are encouraged to continue to engage fully with the project thereafter should they so wish. The fellowship will be held remotely. There are no set hours as this is a voluntary role, but to make the most of the opportunity, we envision a successful fellow devoting an average of 4 hours per week to the initiative in order to learn the technologies and skills, and to create a good lesson. Your commitment is entirely flexible and can be fit around your existing obligations.

The successful applicant will join in our monthly Skype editorial meetings, and will work closely with a mentoring editor. Applicants need not have experience in technical writing, with digital techniques, or with online collaboration - but should be willing to learn about all three. 

##Some reasons to consider applying:

* Hands-on assistance from our editors to develop your ideas into a viable lesson
* Opportunity to become a full team member of our project
* Gain experience in the editorial process
* Develop digital skills, including Git and Markdown
* Learn how to sustain a digital open access project
* Chance to join an enthusiastic all-volunteer initiative that’s making a difference in the digital humanities world.

A good applicant will demonstrate their interest in digital history, methodology, or pedagogy, as well as open access scholarship and community building that is at the heart of the Programming Historian. We would particularly like to encourage applications from those who are keen to learn digital history, but who may not yet be confident in their skills. We welcome applicants from all countries, genders, races, sexual orientations, abilities and disabilities, but due to our own language limits you must be able to speak and write in fluent English.

Interested applicants please send a 2-page CV and brief cover letter to <a href="mailto:adam.crymble@gmail.com">Adam Crymble</a> by 28 February 2015. Successful candidates will be expected to begin their fellowship in the early summer.

The Programming Historian is a peer-reviewed suite of about 30 open access, open content and open source tutorials that help humanists learn a wide range of digital tools, techniques, and workflows to facilitate their research. Despite the name, we do not focus exclusively on programming (or even history), but rather aim to provide guidance on a variety of digital methods and approaches.

We attract over 100,000 users per year, from around the world. And we’re proud of our commitment to open access. We are all volunteers, and we look forward to hearing from you.


##Editorial Team:

* Fred Gibbs, University of New Mexico; 
* Adam Crymble, University of Hertfordshire; 
* Caleb McDaniel, Rice University; 
* Allison Hegel, UCLA; 
* Miriam Posner, UCLA; 
* Jeremy Boggs, University of Virginia; 
* William J. Turkel, Western University

# Get Involved 

Whether you have found a mistake in a lesson, have new ideas for lessons we should add, want to contribute lessons of your own, or have constructive criticisms on how to improve the site, we want to hear from you!

You can report a problem or make suggestions by following our instructions on [how to create an issue in our GitHub repository](https://github.com/programminghistorian/jekyll/wiki/Reporting-Issues).

Or you can email <a href="mailto:fwgibbs@gmail.com">Fred Gibbs</a> with any comments, questions, complaints, or suggestions.  We endeavor to respond to all emails within three working days.

***There are two ways to get involved with the _Programming Historian_***: contribute a lesson or help with editorial work.

-----

## Contribute a Lesson

From our own experiences as well as from our authors, we know that the
difficult job of writing technically challenging but accessible
tutorials is one of the best ways to teach yourself particular skills
and actively engage in the community by passing on some of the tacit
knowledge gained along the way. 

We don't simply accept or reject articles like traditional journals. Our editors collaborate with you to help craft and hone your topic and approach, as well as to make your tutorial as clear and as useful as possible. 

If you'd like to suggest idea to make _Programming Historian_ a more useful resource for you, or propose a lesson (for you or for someone else to write), email <a href="mailto:fwgibbs@gmail.com">Fred Gibbs</a> with your ideas!

## Join our editorial and review team
If writing a lesson isn't for you, perhaps you are ... 

-   Interested in teaching humanists about technology?

-   Wanting to learn new digital humanities tools and techniques, and help
    teach others about them?

-   Hankering for editorial experience you can get credit for?

-   Teaching a digital humanities course where students might
    produce lessons that could be published here?


### Work
As a way of editing lessons as fast as our contributors can generate
them, soliciting new lessons that would best serve our readers, and most
quickly responding to our readers’ needs, we’d love your help. We’re
particularly interested to engage with new editors who can help
recognize potential new lessons that would serve a particular community
need, and work with lesson authors to guide new lessons through the
revision process with an exacting eye for clarity and style.

### Committment and Time
Have you ever wanted some editorial experience? Want to help shape the kinds of
lessons that appear at _Programming Historian_? Whatever your interest and
availability, we’re happy to have your help whenever you can make
time for us. There is no minimum amount you have to do, and we won’t
randomly demand that you do something without asking.

We’re not asking for a long-term or an intensive commitment. The workload
can be however little or much as you’d like. Our hope to is to establish
a pool of editors so that all new lessons can be edited, revised, and
published as fast as possible without any bottlenecks, calling on whomever is available at that time.

### Why

- **Learn:** Editing tutorials is a great way to learn about new tools and
techniques.

- **Visibility:** Your work as a editor/reviewer will be well publicized
at Programming Historian, so everyone will know how awesome you are.

- **Network:** Get to know people working on really cool stuff and
wanting to share it.

- **Karma:** Contribute to a good cause.

If you'd like to be involved as an editor or reviewer, please email <a href="mailto:fwgibbs@gmail.com">Fred Gibbs</a> with a bit of information about yourself, namely the specific skills, tools, topics, and technologies that you'd like to be involved with so that we can send you the most appropriate lessons to review.

Thanks for making _Programming Historian_ such a great resource!
